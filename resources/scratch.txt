OK so I've done some digging and the directly genotyped files that are being plugged into BOLT are:

--bed /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_BasicQC.bed \
    --bim /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_BasicQC.bim \
    --fam /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_BasicQC.v3ImpMod.fam \
    --modelSnps=/rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_QCd_MAF_gt_1pcList.snplist \

The "UKBB_500K_Autosomes_BasicQC" BED files were created by:

These two sequential steps (described in a readme in the same directory)
FILE: UKBB_500K_Autosomes.*
DESCRIPTION: autosomal merge of the unfiltered individual chromosome files
784256 variants and 488377 people pass filters and QC.
FILE: UKBB_500K_Autosomes_BasicQC.*
DESCRIPTION: As above, but excludes the 968 samples which failed QC and don't have imputed genotypes.
Only includes variants which pass QC in all batches.
Not filtered on call rate and will include SNPs present only on one chip.
The 3 redacted samples and sex mismatch samples have not been excluded (so it matches imputed N)
734447 variants and 487409 people pass filters and QC.

We then created a third file with tighter QC:
FILE: UKBB_500K_Autosomes_QCd.*
DESCRIPTION: As above, additionally keeping only variants on both chips and setting overall per-variant call rate to 95%
678894 variants and 487409 people pass filters and QC.
and applied the PLINK command below to create an include list which was supplied to BOLT in the code above using the BasicQC BED file:
--bfile /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_QCd
  --maf 0.01
  --out /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes/UKBB_500K_Autosomes_QCd_MAF_gt_1pcList
  --remove /rds/project/rjh234/rds-rjh234-mrc-epid/Studies/UKBB/IncExc_Lists/EXCLUDEFOR_White_Euro_Relateds_v1.samples
  --write-snplist





don't ask me about any of the logic behind this as it's long left my head! I remember discussing this with Po-Ru before years ago and I think he approves
our BOLT estimates have been comparable, if not slightly better, than other groups
I'd suggest digging around in log files in this directory: /rds/project/rds-eaZo6NNYfvE/Studies/UKBB/Genotyped/merged_autosomes
